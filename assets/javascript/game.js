// Select a character from the Force or Darkside. Depending on selection put the opposite group in the "Enemies Available To Attack" section

// Player chooses to fight one of the characters. Selected character moves to the "Fight Section" all the rest remain in the "Enemies Available To Attack" section

// Build "Attack" button... Enemy HP - Players AP = New Enemy HP && Player HP - Enemy CT = New Player HP. Players AP increase by initial number with every press of "Attack" ie. 6,12,18,24.

// if Enemy HP = 0, allow player to select new enemy to fight. if all characters have been defeated display "You've defeated the Dark Side or Force". The player stats need to be remembered from one enemy to another. HP doesn't reset possible increase a bit between enemies

// if player character HP = 0, Display " You have been defeated!!" then "Please play again"
